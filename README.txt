Latex class file to use: iimbthesis.cls

This temaplate the FPM office requirements (esp. the title pages) as on
2013 when I submitted my thesis. 

All the files necessary to get the pdf output up and running are included 
in the folder. All one has to do on a windows pc would be to 
execute the "CompilePDF.bat" file and your pdf thesis should be ready.

Make sure you set you latex(MIktex) to autodownload missing packages
on the go (you need to be connected to net while complining) 
so that all the necessary packages used in the template
are automatically downloaded and installed while you are compiling.


Note!!! that the template generates seperate reference sections for
each chapter. I did that to facilitate people writing thesis in
three essay format. (as i also did) 
the temaplate can be made to put all the references at the
end of the thesis as well. (pls figure that out, its not that complicated)

Feel free to modify the class file as per your requirements 
or as improvements. 

The thesis may be generated as onesided or twosided (mind the margins!).

Some text used in the template is what i used in my thesis you may
replace that with your own.

I am retaining examples with 

1. equations
2. figures
3. tables: portrait and landscape, scaled, as well as mutlipage
4. computer code listing support
5. Appendix
5. some more helpful utitlites for better looking tables, chapter titles etc.
