## Template Overview
This LaTeX template (`iimbthesis.cls`) is designed to meet the specific requirements of the FPM office at IIMB, especially regarding title pages, as of 2013, when I submitted my PhD thesis. It includes all necessary files to produce a complete PDF of your thesis.

## Getting Started
1. **LaTeX Class File:** Use `iimbthesis.cls` for formatting your thesis.
2. **Compilation:** Run the `CompilePDF.bat` file on a Windows PC to compile your thesis into a PDF. This script automates the LaTeX build process.
3. **Package Management:** Ensure LaTeX (e.g., MiKTeX) is configured to automatically download missing packages. A stable internet connection is required during the compilation process for this feature.

## Features
- **Modular References:** The template supports separate reference sections for each chapter, catering to theses written in a three-essay format. However, it can be easily modified to consolidate references at the end.
- **Flexible Formatting:** Options for one-sided or two-sided printing are available (be mindful of margin adjustments).
- **Customizable:** Feel free to modify the class file and other elements to suit your specific needs or to implement improvements.
- **Inclusions:** Examples and support are provided for equations, figures (including portrait and landscape orientation, scaling, and multi-page), tables, computer code listings, appendices, and other useful formatting utilities.

## Customization
Parts of the template, including sample text and examples, are taken from my own thesis. You should replace these with your own content. The template is versatile, allowing for various types of content and formatting needs.

## Contributions
Your contributions to improve this template are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
